        For p1_milestone, I was primarily responsible for managing health,
        pickups, the UI to display them, as well as godmode.
      </li>
      <li>
        For p1_alpha, my main responsibility was setting up the game's
        progression. I was in charge of studying the original dungeon and then
        getting enemies to spawn in the right places when the player enters a
        room. To do this, I also needed to create a spawner entity that would
        handle the start and end of a room's combat. I also make the old man
        room and learned how to put canvases into the world in the process.
        Finally, I created Aquamentus as well as its fireballs.

        p1_gold was originaly my idea, although there's no doubt that my
        teammates contributed immensely to coming up with its concept. I was
        largely the one in charge of creating the dash mechanic while my
        teammates worked on making the level it would be used in. I was also
        responsible for, the dash pickup, the stamina system, the new UI with
        the health bar and stamina bar, and I also used random websites to
        create custom NES-era sounds and sprites. I also came up with the idea
        of making green enemies, and I implemented a green stalfos, keese, and
        goriya as a proof of concept. Only the stalfos made it into the final
        build.
      </li>

        p1_gold began as a deranged 5-hour coding binge where I tried to turn
        our build of Zelda into one of my favorite games currently, ULTRAKILL.
        In that game the player dashes quickly with the use of a stamina system
        and kills enemies to increase their style rating. I implmented both the
        stamina-fueled dashes as well as the style system and created a testing
        room with Samus enemies to kill. My teammates weren't too impressed when
        I proposed that we could use this for our p1_gold build, and rightfully
        so. There wasn't a lot to do with the style mechanic, it mostly existed
        for its own sake. Instead, what they ended up enjoying was the dash, and
        it led to us eventually turning it into the entirety of our p1_gold. I'm
        glad I had my teammates to give me feedback as, if I did p1_gold alone,
        I probably would have done something silly with the style system after
        going through all the trouble of making it, rather than dropping it like
        I should have.
